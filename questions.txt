1.  getrusage is used to get the amount of resources used by the process.

3.  This is done to save memory space, by passing by reference, only pointers to the structure is created and
    not an entire new structure to store values.

4.  The words created are all alphabetical (with ') and any alphanumeric words are not created.
    The for gets a single character(int) from the file. If it is an alphabet or an apostrophe, it adds the
    character to word and increments the index. If the index exceeds 45(LENGTH) it means that the word is
    invalid and is dicarded by resetting index to zero 
   
    If the character is a digit, it discards the rest of the word by getting characters until a whitespace
    comes or a EOF is reached and resetting index to zero. If the above errors are not encountered, and
    index is greater than zero, we append \0 to the end of word and increment the words variable. We then
    call check to validate the word.

5.  using fscanf can cause formatting problems as it stops at whitespaces and also a waste of memory if the 
    word is alphanumeric.

6.  It is done to prevent any accidental changes to the word/dictionary.
